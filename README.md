# BrayJL
Simple game engine using OpenGL and C++.

## The Idea
The idea for BrayJL is to create a simple 3D game engine that is fast and lightweight compared to other commercial game engines.

## Credits
Right now BrayJL is using temporary assets for testing functionality as we develop the engine. Here is a list of the asset creators:
#### 3D models
- [Knight Artorias and Great Grey Wolf Sif](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/knight-artorias-and-great-grey-wolf-sif-bdf57355f95a420fa0c5b3e924bea16d) by [9S](https://sketchfab.com/NlNES)
- [Tifa Lockhart (FF:VII) (HD)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tifa-lockhart-ffvii-hd-682acb22cd84435b8f4a1e5d6dc3598d) by [Senpai-3689](https://sketchfab.com/Senpai3689)

## Build
Currently, BrayJL only supports Windows.

#### 1. Cloning the repository
  Start by cloning the repository with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/BJL156/BrayJL.git
```
#### 2. Build the solution
  After cloning the repository, you can build the Visual Studio 2022 solution by changing directories into the newly created `BrayJL` directory, and running `build.bat` with the following command:
```
cd BrayJL && .\build.bat
```

#### 3. Build and run
  Once the solution has been built, open the file `BrayJL.sln`. All that's left is to build the solution either by pressing `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`B` or by going to `Build > Build Solution`.
