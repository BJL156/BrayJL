# BrayJL
Simple game engine using OpenGL and C++.

## The Idea
The idea for BrayJL is to create a powerful 3D game engine that is fast and light weight compared to other commercial game engines. We want make an engine with a lot of power, but easy to use.

## Build
Currently BrayJL only support Windows.

#### 1. Cloning the repository
  Start by cloning the repository with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/BJL156/BrayJL.git
```
#### 2. Build the solutiuon
  After cloning the repository, you can build the Visual Studio 2022 solution by changing directories into the newly created `BrayJL` directory, and running `build.bat` with the following command:
```
cd BrayJL && .\build.bat
```

#### 3. Build and run
  Once the solution has been built, all that's left is to build the solution and run by hitting `F5` on the keyboard or going into `Build > Build Solution` then pressing the run button.
