# BrayJL
Simple game engine using OpenGL and C++.

# Build
Currently BrayJL only support Windows.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/BJL156/BrayJL` and change working directory into `BrayJL` via the command `cd BrayJL`. Then to build the BrayJL engine just run the `.\build.bat` file.

This will create a Visual Studio 2022 solution with two projects: `Engine` and `Application`. To run the program it's as simple as opening the solution and hitting `F5`.
